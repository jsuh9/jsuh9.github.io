Albert Einstein is one of my all time favorite scientists.
If he were alive today, would he still choose us?

I sincerely hope so. However, I am genuinely concerned.

This country has a special place in my heart, not just because I am a citizen of this country.

Dreaming of rockets, blackholes, intergalactic travels, and the iconic NASA stamps on magnificent galaxy photos, I came here as a foreign exchange student, warmly welcomed by a kind-hearted American host family in a small town of less than 3000 people (with only three Asian residents, according to one local lady at the time). There, I grew and experienced some good and bad sides of American life, mostly kind, welcoming, and occasionally some racism. 

Despite some unnerving experiences, the positive sides far outweighed the negatives, at least for me. I embraced the challenges and sought to seize the opportunities that America offered. Freedom, innovation, and the promise of the American Dream were all too great for me to pass. I aspired to be part of this grand narrative, a story built upon the ambitions and hopes of immigrants like myself.

When presented with the opportunity, I proudly joined the U.S. Army, dedicating myself with all my best because I was determined to "earn" and "prove" my place in this country. You might judge me as naive, but given the chance to decide again, I would have still made the same choice.

I recall the day I took my citizenship oath; it was fittingly on July 4th, in Virginia, wearing my U.S. Army dress uniform. It was a profound moment of pride and gratitude, deeply meaningful even years later as I recall it during these hard times.

However, these past several days have been surreal and deeply unsettling. Many colleagues and friends in academia are now experiencing great distress simply because they are here as "international." Their visas have been inexplicably revoked without clear justification, and without fair due processes. I'm not here to speculate on the reasons or methods behind these actions, but my heart tells me unmistakably that this is wrong, and we should make it right. Most of these affected individuals are harmless, dedicated scholars whose only "crime," if one could even call it that, is probably their curiosity and passion for advancing knowledge.

This is not the perception of America I want by these future scholars, whereever they may be. This is not the nation whose ideals could inspire a young student like me in the past. Sudden and unjust actions like these breed fear and uncertainty, chasing away dreamers, innovators, and diligent scholars.

These kind, talented, law-abiding scholars who are committed to uncovering truth, disseminating knowledge, mentoring young students, and attracting global talent now consider leaving, or rather "fleeing."

Do you have people you know that suffer these problems?
If you are an American, what can you possibly say to these people? 
As an American, and as an immigrant myslef, I honestly do not know what to tell them.

Again, if Albert were alive today, would he still choose us as a place to move from Germany?
I sincerely hope so. -->
