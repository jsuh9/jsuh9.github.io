I believe that a single <em>very effective</em> way of learning things is by presenting things to others.

It forces us to try and learn the topic of our presentation: it leverages our ego.
However, it is a blessing that, even with our attempts to save our precious ego, we eventually find ourselves in the wrong many times. (Of course, the safest strategy to not embarass yourself is to do nothing.)

Over time, I came to appreciate being wrong in front of others (killing my ego and optimizing learning).
Being "clearly wrong" is easier for others to correct you, and the first step to being clearly wrong is to speak up and communicate the wrong idea that you have to others.

So, amazinlgly, presenting things to others not only leverages our own ego but also utilizes other people's brains to your own benefits, all at the same time!

How is this simple act of communication so useful?
No need for any sophisticated digital machineries.
We just need our default options, a mouth and ears, they allow us to plug in our little hemispheres into others for our own benefits!
