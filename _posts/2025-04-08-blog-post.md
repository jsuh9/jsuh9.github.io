My professional (with a hint of personal) website is up!


For a long time, I was thinking about setting up my own website for various reasons including professional self-development, and personal. I had a simple working website based on a popular HTML5 UP template based on a personal website workshop I attended a couple of years ago but it was a bit difficult to customize...

Recently, I helpd set up our lab's website ([NCS Lab](https://networked-control-systems-lab.github.io/)) using AcademicPages template. I liked the looks, and most importantly, I got used to it. 

So here it is. This is my own personal + professional website, and I am quite satisfied with the layout so far.

Every so often, I will write a brief blog post. The primary motivation for this activity is <em>Education</em> but really for educating myself. For this reason, I am going to excuse myself, and select topics based on my preferences, and adopt styles I like. After all, I am under no obligations, right?

Today we have a vast number of avaialble resources at our fingertips literally. Many of them are super high-quality, written by some super smart people! These ideas being available online, accessible (at least physically) to almost anyone, and anywhere in the world at any points in time is already a remarkable gift to our generation!

Still, Iâ€™ve found that some of these resources feel "mentally" inaccessible. Not saying that the quality of these resources is bad or anything wrong pedagogically. They are actually very good but really very fine-tuned for specific targe audiences.

Often some concepts can be explained at multiple levels, and knowing how to do this is difficult, at least I find it so.
As a part of academic community, knowing how to do this is very important, not just as an educator but also as a researcher.

One of my personal lifelong missions is to help make advanced technical knowledge "mentally" (not just physical) accessibile to anyone who is curious. But it is also not in vain if I fail to do so, as it should at least benefit my past (and current) self who struggle(d). I hope the way I present what I understand adds a value to those who want to learn.
