My professional (with a hint of personal) website is up!


For a long time, I was thinking about setting up my own website for various reasons including professional self-development, and personal. I had a simple working website based on a popular HTML5 UP template based on a personal website workshop I attended a couple of years ago but it was a bit difficult to customize...

Recently, I helpd set up our lab's website ([NCS Lab](https://networked-control-systems-lab.github.io/)) using AcademicPages template. I liked the looks, and most importantly, I got used to it. 

So here it is. This is my own personal + professional website, and I am quite satisfied with the layout so far.

Every so often, I will write a brief blog post. The primary motivation for this activity is <em>Education</em> but really for educating myself. For this reason, I am going to excuse myself, and select topics based on my preferences, and adopt styles I like. After all, I am under no obligations, right?

Today we have a vast number of avaialble resources at our fingertips literally. Many of them are super high-quality, written by some super smart people! These ideas being available online, accessible (at least physically) to almost anyone, and anywhere in the world at any points in time is already a remarkable gift to our generation!

However, I must say that some of them are rather unfriendly to an average person like myself, that they are "mentally" inaccessible for some people. It is not the teacher's fault; often they are just unable to see our inability to understand things because they had no such difficulties themselves. And of course they are moslty just too busy unfortunately as our society burdens them with other valued (profit-generating) actitivities than teaching.

My ambitious personal mission is to make advanced technical knowledge mentally (not just physical) accessibile for anyone who is genuinely curious and eager to learn. If not for the society, it should benefit my past self who struggled; but I do sincerely hope that there are enough people like me who find my attempts to explain things helpful for them, even just a little.

This motivates me to focus on clarity and communication. I am going to try to make things understandable but I fully realize that this is very difficult, and perhaps I fail most of the time. If you find it unclear, please let me know, and I will do my best to improve.
