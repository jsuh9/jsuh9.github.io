My professional website is up!
======

For a long time, I was thinking about setting up my own professional (and personal) website.
I had a simple working website based on a popular HTML5 UP template based on a personal website workshop I attended a couple of years ago but it was a bit difficult to customize...

Recently, I helpd set up our lab's website ([NCS Lab](https://networked-control-systems-lab.github.io/)) using AcademicPages template. I liked the looks, and most importantly, I got used to it. 

So here it is.
This is my own professional website, and I am quite satisfied with it.
Every often, I am going to post a blog, mostly related to my research activities but sometimes unrelated (hopefully if I have time). 
Ideally, I am hoping it can serve as a reference to my future-self, and perhaps to others who are onto similar research activities...
