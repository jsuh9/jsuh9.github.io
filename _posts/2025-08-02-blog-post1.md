Wow, again. It has been...so long since I wrote a blog post.
Life has been busy. I am preparing for one of the big milestones towards graduation...
I feel like I finally can see, and feel the end.

I did not, not at all, think or could not imagine how long this journey would take.
To some poeple, it may just be another piece of paper. But to me, it is much more than that.
It's not the prestige, it's not the knowldege I gained, it's not the future opportunity it presents.
It is the time that we somehow for whatever reasons decided and committed, by choice, to put up in our twenties, and thirties.
Nothing external but internal...that is what needs to be endured.

Anyways, it's been several months already since I moved to Purdue.
This summer, I found much joy in living with fireflies, frogs, ducks and rabbits every morning and every sunset.
It warms my heart somehow. They remind me of the dark sky full of stars I fell in love when I first came to the US.

I feel very grateful that I got to spend the latter parts of my studies in such a beautiful environment.
In times of unceratinties, it makes me feel at ease, help me be optimistic, and help me pause, and appreciate.
So thank you to fireflies, frogs, ducks, and rabbits, and a beautiful summer sky here, West Lafayette.
