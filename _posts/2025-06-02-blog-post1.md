Why do we write? Why should we write?

Whether we like it or not, in various professional tasks, writing is essential.
Several posts ago, I thought about the benefits of giving a talk/presentation.
Presenting to others certainly communicates your ideas to the audience but what's often overlooked is its benefits to ourselves, such as externally motivating ourselves to think critically, and to improve our initial random ideas using fresh perspectives.

Writing functions similarly but its benefits (but also detriments) could be far reaching and less ephemeral,
possibly because writing is a high stake activity (it follows you) and as it requires a ton of efforts and practices (it never ends).

What does this mean for me personally? I need to force myself to write more.
One counterintuitive self-imposed lesson I try to remember is this:
        Writing is not to be judged (well, sort of but); it is more of a tool (medium) to help myself, to learn concepts, and to refine ideas.

By writing on my personal webpage, I try to nudge myself to write about things (regardless of what) more often than I would professionally.

These are some of the reasons that motivate me to write here regularly.
