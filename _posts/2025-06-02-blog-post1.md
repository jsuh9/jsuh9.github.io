Why do we write? Why should we write?

If we like it or not, in various professional tasks, writing is essential.
Several posts ago, I thought about the benefits of giving a talk/presentation.
It certainly communicates your ideas to the audience but what's often overlooked is that it benefits ourselves more in terms of critical thinking and improving our ideas.

Writing functions similarly but its benefits (but also detriments) could be far reaching and less ephemeral.
Naturally, writing is a high stake activity and it requires a ton of efforts and practices.

What does this mean for me personally? I tend to think too much and not write as early as I should.
But over the years, I learned a simple but important lesson.

Writing is not to be judged (well, sort of but still...) but it is more of a tool to help me learn concepts, and refine ideas.

By writing on my personal webpage, I try to nudge myself to write about things more often than I would professionally (as the judging part weighs in more there).

These are some of the reasons that motivate me to write here regularly.
