Hi, I am a PhD student at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) in the [School of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE). I am advised by Dr. Tanaka at the [Networked Control Systems Lab](https://networked-control-systems-lab.github.io/).

My research lies at the intersection of [control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory) and [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography)---a novel research field called <em>Encrypted Control</em>. In this research, we apply an advanced cryptographic protocol called <em>[homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption)</em> into control systems [Cyber-Physical Systems](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/cps-cyber-physical-systems) to **enable a privacy-preserving, secure decision-making** in the networekd control systems.

This is my professional webpage as well as my personal blog.
You can check out my CV, publications, or read up on my latest blog posts.
You can also find links to all my professional outlets on the side (or on top for mobile viewers).
